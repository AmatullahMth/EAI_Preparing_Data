# EAI_Preparing_Data
In this repository we look at importing data from a csv formatted file into a google sheets file to make it readable, cleaning the data, creating visualizations of the data on google sheets, and representing our insights as a report.

## Overview of the project
* We are going to draw some insight on one of the UN SDGs(Sustainable Development Goal) which is: access to safe and affordable drinking water focussing on inequalities in services levels between different countries and regions.
* We are going to asses the progress towards achieving this goal between 2000 - 2020.
* The dataset classifies the level of access to safe and affordable drinking water into 5 different service levels:
* |Service Level  | Description                                                                                                                                            |
  |---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  |Safely Managed |Drinking water from an improved source that is accessible on premises, available when needed, and free from faecal and priority chemical contamination. |
  |Basic          |Drinking water from an improved source, provided collection time is not more than 30 minutes for a round trip, including queue time.                    |
  |Limited        |Drinking water from an improved source, for which collection time exceeds 30 minutes for a round trip, including queue time.                            |
  |Unimproved     |Drinking water from an unprotected dug well or unprotected spring.                                                                                      |
  |Surface water  |Drinking water directly from a river, dam, lake, pond, stream, canal, or irrigation canal.                                                              |

## There are 3 parts to this project
1. Import and clean data
2. Create new features and visualizations
3. Interpret the results

##Tools we'll be using
* Google sheets
